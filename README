eIQ Sample Apps
===============

This repository includes the source codes for some demo applications to get started
with the eIQ Toolkit.

For more informations on the demos please check: https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-343785

For information on how to deploy the demos to an i.MX8 board, please check: https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-345134

Dependencies
============

The demos in this repository target i.MX8* processors running the BSP
imx-image-full image, which provides all of the needed packages for machine
learning enablement.

Many of these demos depends on a graphic windowing support which is not enabled
by default in imx-image-full for L4.19.35. To enable this graphic support, add
the following to your local.conf file and rebuild imx-image-full.

To enable Qt5 windowing support:
```
PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-opencv_mx8 = " qt5 jasper test"
```

To enable GTK windowing support:
```
PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-opencv_mx8 = " gtk jasper test"
```

Available Applications
======================

* Arm NN inference engine:
Handwritten Digit Recognition
Object Recognition using camera or file input

* OpenCV DNN inference engine:
Object Recognition using camera or file input

* TensorFlow Lite:
Face Recognition

Branches
========

* master: master branch
* techdays_hands-on: branch for Tech Days eIQ Hands-on.
